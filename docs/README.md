# Project Docs

- `docs/architecture.md`: architecture and contract notes.
- `docs/commands.md`: canonical command examples.
- Command example source of truth: update `docs/commands.md` first; keep `README.md` to a short onboarding subset that links back here.
- `docs/releasing.md`: release process and artifact expectations.
- `docs/decisions/`: architecture decision records.
- `scripts/smoke.sh`: local end-to-end smoke validation script.
